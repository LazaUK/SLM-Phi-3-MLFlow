# Building a wrapper and using Phi-3 as an MLFlow model

MLflow is an open-source platform designed to streamline the entire machine learning (ML) lifecycle. It helps data scientists track experiments, manage their ML models and deploy them into production, ensuring reproducibility and efficient collaboration.

In this repo, I'll show 2 different approaches on building a wrapper around Phi-3 small language model (SLM), and then running it as an MLFlow model either locally or in a cloud, e.g. in Azure Machine Learning workspace.
